      CITY EYE as a segment of CITY GUARD project, allows the inclusion of wide variety of participants in simple creation of central issue repository of communal problems. Through various ways of reporting perceived problems in the field, it allows all participants to create systematic issue tracking with possibility to assign them to person in charge, without further effort and technical knowledge.

      Such a wide "mobilization" and the synergistic effect of all participants (municipal employees, local committees,,...) achieves additional efficiency and fully justifies the introduction of system in environments where traffic problems fluctuate with their intensity (throughout the season).
